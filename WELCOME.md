# WELCOME TO THE REPO OF THE MOLECULAR SIMULATION RESEARCH GROUP OF THE UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE COLOMBIA

## What will you find here

Usefull scripts, templates and guides to run simulations on GROMACS (and more software comming in the future)

## How to use the scripts?

You can use this scripts in different ways:

- We recommend to clone the repository and handle it via git. If you are new to git see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
- You can also download the source code, that you need, however updates and bugs-fixing won't be reflected on your local code
- Ideally, all scripts have an ABOUT.md file with basi usage. Some scripts will also have a `-h` function. And off-course, feel free to ask us.
 
## How can I contribute?

We welcome any contribution from researchers on the field. So if you want to contribute pleas keep in mind:

- You need to request write-level permission with any of the maintainers.
- Do your changes locally on a separate branch. **Pro-Tip:** Never work on the master branch because any push will be rejected.
- If you are adding a new script, add an ABOUT file and save the script in a separate folder. ABOUT files take around 20 minutes to write but will save hours of understanding and debugging for future users - or yourself.
- Once you are sure you want to submit the modifications or new scripts, commit all your changes, push your branch and request a merge to the master branch.
